# Holiday Cards 2022

A method of sending holiday cards to people I know. Built using [p5.js](https://p5js.org), [c2.js](https://c2js.org), and [p5.Polar](https://github.com/liz-peng/p5.Polar). Deployed using GitHub Pages.

All messages are encrypted and going to [the site](https://michaelmbradley.github.io/holidaycards2022/) without a key will show an error message, but you can [view an example message here](https://michaelmbradley.github.io/holidaycards2022/?key=OkHPKD9PPdVsys96DHyIfukmIaAGIlEmrz3ABgHiKNE). Messages are currently only displayed in the console, but a proper method to display them will be implemented soon.
